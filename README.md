# BTH_Leaderboard_Generator
Simple Java application that parses discord messages by the moon tournament bot and creates a .txt leaderboard

To parse the input.txt, run ParseBotMessage.java

You might want to set the argument "-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true" in your JVM for the program to work properly.
